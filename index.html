                <h2>Subtheme: Demographic and Geographic Analysis of Fatal Accidental Overdoses in Allegheny County</h2>

                <h3> Introduction</h3>
               <p> In this assignment, we will perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset from the Western Pennsylvania
                 Regional Data Center, which documents fatal accidental overdoses in Allegheny County. This dataset includes detailed 
                 information on overdose incidents, such as age, gender, race, drugs involved, and the zip codes of both the incident
                  and residence. The goal of this analysis is to uncover trends and patterns in overdose deaths, providing insights
                   into the demographic and geographical factors associated with these incidents. By examining the data, we aim to 
                   better understand the dynamics of the overdose crisis in the county and identify potential areas for intervention.</p>
                
                <h3> Dataset:Fatal Accidental Overdoses in Allegheny County </h3>
                <p>The dataset, titled "Fatal Accidental Overdoses in Allegheny County," 
                is published monthly by the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center and contains information 
                on fatal accidental overdoses occurring in Allegheny County. It includes variables such as Age, Gender, 
                Race, Drugs Present, Zip Code of Incident, and Zip Code of Residence.<br>
                This dataset is available for download in CSV format from the following link: 
    <a href="https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-fatal-accidental-overdoses/resource/1c59b26a-1684-4bfb-92f7-205b947530cf" target="_blank">Fatal Accidental Overdoses Dataset</a>. </p>
                <h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong> is the relationship between age and the likelihood of fatal accidental overdose?</strong><br>The motivation for this question stems
                         from the perception that I keep hearing  that younger individuals (ages 15-35) are often reported to be at higher risk for fatal
                          drug overdoses. This interest in verifying this perception using data from the dataset aims to reveal how different age groups 
                          are affected by substance abuse and to provide a data-driven understanding of age-related risks. <br> </li>

                    <li> <strong> Are there significant differences in overdose rates across Black and White race individuals?</strong><br> The motive behind this question is  
                        to explore potential racial disparities in overdose rates, which is crucial for addressing public health inequalities. 
                        Reports from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) highlight racial and ethnic differences in drug use and overdose,
                         underscoring the importance of examining this issue in this dataset.<br></li>

                    <li><strong> How does the distribution of overdose deaths vary between males and females? </strong><br>Investigating gender differences in 
                        overdose deaths helps to understand which gender is more affected, potentially informing targeted prevention strategies. 
                        Conversations with friends suggest that males are more likely to die from drug overdoses due to higher drug usage. 
                        This dataset offers an opportunity to explore whether this perception holds true. </li>

                    <li><strong> Which top 5 years recorded the highest number of fatal accidental overdose incidents?</strong> Identifying years with peak overdose 
                        incidents can help in understanding trends and assessing the impact of interventions or policy changes over time. 
                        This question is motivated by the need to evaluate historical trends in overdose data, as it is shown here:
                         <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm" target="_blank">CDC Drug overdose death</a><br>  </li>

                    <li><strong> What are the common chemical names of drugs that lead to overdose deaths?</strong> <br> Identifying common drugs involved in
                         overdose deaths can aid in developing targeted prevention strategies and awareness campaigns to stop people 
                        taking much of them or even stop using them. This is driven by the need to understand the most harmful substances as shown here:
                        <a href="https://www.dea.gov/factsheets" target="_blank">CDC Drug overdose death</a><br> </li>
                    <li><strong> What are the geographic patterns of overdose deaths based on zip codes?</strong><br>Identifying geographic patterns of overdose deaths 
                        is crucial for recognizing areas with higher overdose rates and focusing intervention efforts effectively. 
                        The CDC's National Center for Health Statistics frequently includes geographic data in its reports, highlighting 
                        the importance of such analyses.<br></li>
                    <li><strong> What are the trends in the rates of fatal accidental overdoses over the years?</strong><br> Analyzing trends over time can reveal whether overdose 
                        rates are increasing or decreasing, helping to evaluate the effectiveness of public health measures. 
                        This question is driven by the need to track progress and adapt strategies. 
                        The CDC and National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) provide historical data and trends on overdose rates, making this analysis critical<//br></li>

                <figure>
                    <img src="Images/yearly.png" alt=""style="max-width: 80%; height: auto;">
                    <figcaption>
                    At first , we will look at the number of deaths in every year from 2007 to 2024 as the above graph shows. The graph illustrates a 
                    complex trend in overdose deaths from 2007 to 2024. There's a general upward trajectory, with deaths more than
                     tripling from 223 in 2007 to a peak of 735 in 2017. This spike in 2017 likely reflects a critical point in the
                      opioid crisis, possibly due to the increased prevalence of potent synthetic opioids like fentanyl. 
                      Interestingly, there's a sharp decline to 427 deaths in 2018, which could indicate rapid implementation
                       of emergency measures or increased public awareness following the 2017 crisis. The years 2020-2022 show a 
                       relative plateau around 580 deaths annually, suggesting a possible stabilization of the crisis or the emergence
                        of a new equilibrium. However, the drastically lower figure for 2024 (143 deaths) is likely due to incomplete 
                        data for the ongoing year.

                        The monthly distribution of overdose deaths reveals significant seasonal patterns, with April showing 
                        the highest incidence, followed by August and December, while January has the lowest. This trend suggests 
                        complex factors influencing overdose risks throughout the year. The spring peak in April may be linked to
                         seasonal affective disorder transitions, tax season stress, or academic pressures. August's increase could
                          relate to summer social activities or end-of-season job losses, while December's high numbers likely reflect
                           holiday-related stresses and increased social gatherings. January's low might indicate New Year's resolution 
                           effects. These insights call for targeted interventions and resource allocation, particularly intensifying 
                           prevention and support efforts during high-risk months. Healthcare providers should prepare for increased 
                           demand during peak periods.

                        The distribution of overdose deaths across gender and race reveals that White individual account
                         for the highest number of deaths (5,679), significantly more than any other racial group. 
                         Black individuals follow with 1,377 deaths, while other racial categories (H, I, M, O, U) 
                         show relatively lower numbers of fatalities. This pattern might reflect demographic factors
                          or disparities in access to healthcare, drug use prevalence, or intervention measures across
                        different racial groups.since black and white race sidnigies large number of deaths in
                           the next analysis I will be using them to analyse the data.

                    <figcaption>
                        When focusing on Black and White individuals, the bar chart shows that White men have the highest
                         number of overdose deaths, followed by Black men. White women come next, with Black women having the
                          lowest number of deaths in this group. Overall, men are more affected by fatal overdoses than women 
                          in both racial groups. This aligns with common findings that men are generally at higher risk for 
                          substance-related fatalities. However, the significantly higher overdose deaths among White individuals 
                          compared to Black individuals suggest potential demographic or socio-economic factors that may contribute
                           to this disparity, such as drug availability, usage patterns and beliefs.

                    <figcaption>
                        The age distribution of overdose deaths reveals an unexpected concentration among individuals 
                        aged 30 to 35, contrary to the initial assumption that the highest rates would occur in the 20 to 30 age group. 
                        This indicates that slightly older individuals may be more vulnerable to fatal overdoses, potentially due to longer-term 
                        substance use or other socio-economic stressors. The next most affected age groups are 45 to 50 and 40 to 45, with the least
                         fatalities occurring in the 85 to 95 age range, likely reflecting the smaller population size of older individuals using these drugs. 
                         To focus on more relevant data, I plan to remove these outliers and re-visualize the top five most affected age groups.

                        The analysis of common chemical drugs involved in overdose deaths shows that substances like Fentanyl, 
                        Cocaine, and Heroin are prominently associated with fatalities. Fentanyl leads with 350 deaths, followed 
                        closely by Cocaine with 334 and Heroin with 318 deaths. Combinations of these drugs, such as Fentanyl and 
                        Heroin or Fentanyl and Cocaine, also feature prominently in the dataset. Alcohol, often combined with other
                         drugs, also appears frequently among the substances linked to overdose deaths. This pattern highlights the
                          critical role these drugs play in fatal overdoses and suggests that there need some interventions to take
                           precautions on these substances by the in charge institutions to reduce number of people being killed by
                         this combination of chemicals.

                        The dataset reveals a significant gender disparity in overdose deaths, 
                        with males accounting for 4,934 deaths, more than double the number of female fatalities (2,202). 
                        This supports the perception that males are more likely to die from drug overdoses, possibly due to higher 
                        drug usage rates or engagement in riskier behaviors. This finding underscores the need for targeted prevention 
                        strategies focusing on males, who appear to be at greater risk. Further investigation into social,
                         psychological, or behavioral factors driving this gender difference could help in developing more effective 
                         interventions.

                        The top 10 substances involved in overdose deaths highlight a critical focus on several high-risk drugs.
                         Fentanyl emerges as the leading drug with 350 deaths, followed closely by Cocaine with 334 and Heroin with 
                         318 fatalities. Combinations of these substances, such as Fentanyl and Heroin, and Cocaine and Fentanyl,
                          are also significant contributors to overdose deaths. The visualization indicates that single drugs like
                           Alcohol and multi-drug combinations play a substantial role in fatalities, with Alcohol alone accounting
                            for 67 deaths and various combinations of Cocaine, Fentanyl, and Heroin contributing to a large number 
                            of cases. This analysis illustrates the high risk associated with these substances and suggests that
                             targeted prevention efforts should prioritize prohibition of these top drugs and their common combinations
                              to reduce overdose deaths effectively.

                        The geographic distribution of overdose deaths reveals significant concentrations in various
                         neighborhoods within Pittsburgh, PA. The South Side, known for its vibrant community and nightlife, 
                         has the highest number of overdose deaths. The North Side, including areas like Allegheny Center, 
                         also reports a high incidence of fatalities. Other neighborhoods with notable overdose death counts i
                         nclude Penn Hills, which encompasses a broader area with a diverse population, and Beltzhoover, 
                         a residential area in the southern part of the city.Conversely, neighborhoods with lower overdose death counts 
                         include areas like Upper Lawrenceville and parts of the East End, such as Point Breeze and Squirrel Hill.
                         This variance suggests that while some areas face critical overdose crises, others experience fewer incidents.

                        The absence of years such as 2018, 2019, and 2020 from the top 5 list of years 
                        with the highest overdose deaths can be attributed to several factors. 
                        Drug trends and prevalence can vary significantly over time, with shifts in 
                        substance use patterns impacting overall mortality rates. Additionally, public 
                        health interventions during these years, such as harm reduction strategies and
                         increased access to treatment, may have contributed to a temporary decline in overdose deaths. 
                         Another consideration is the potential reporting lag, particularly for 2020, where data might be
                          incomplete or delayed due to disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic could have 
                          also influenced drug use patterns and overdose statistics through increased isolation, stress, and 
                          changes in drug availability. These factors together highlight the complex nature of the overdose crisis
                           and underscore the need for a detailed examination of each year's data to understand the underlying trends 
                           and influences.

                <h2>Summary</h2>
                The report provides a comprehensive analysis of fatal accidental overdose deaths, revealing several key insights. Age distribution analysis indicates that individuals aged 30 to 35 experience the highest number of overdose deaths, contrary to the initial expectation of a younger age group being more affected. Gender-wise, males are significantly more affected than females, with 4,934 male deaths compared to 2,202 female deaths, supporting the notion that drug use is more prevalent among men. Racial disparities are evident, with White individuals having the highest death toll at 5,679, followed by Black individuals at 1,377, suggesting a pronounced racial gap in overdose fatalities. The analysis of drug types highlights that Fentanyl, Cocaine, and Heroin are the leading causes of overdose deaths. Geographic analysis of overdose deaths across various areas of Pittsburgh reveals that certain neighborhoods experience higher rates of fatalities, which could inform targeted intervention strategies. Additionally, trends over the years show fluctuations in overdose death rates, with the highest numbers recorded in 2017, 2016, 2022, 2021, and 2023, indicating variability in the impact of overdoses over time.
