                <h2>Subtheme: Demographic and Geographic Analysis of Fatal Accidental Overdoses in Allegheny County</h2>

                <h3> Introduction</h3>
               <p> In this assignment, we will perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset from the Western Pennsylvania
                 Regional Data Center, which documents fatal accidental overdoses in Allegheny County. This dataset includes detailed 
                 information on overdose incidents, such as age, gender, race, drugs involved, and the zip codes of both the incident
                  and residence. The goal of this analysis is to uncover trends and patterns in overdose deaths, providing insights
                   into the demographic and geographical factors associated with these incidents. By examining the data, we aim to 
                   better understand the dynamics of the overdose crisis in the county and identify potential areas for intervention.</p>
                
                <h3> Dataset:Fatal Accidental Overdoses in Allegheny County </h3>
                <p>The dataset, titled "Fatal Accidental Overdoses in Allegheny County," 
                is published monthly by the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center and contains information 
                on fatal accidental overdoses occurring in Allegheny County. It includes variables such as Age, Gender, 
                Race, Drugs Present, Zip Code of Incident, and Zip Code of Residence.<br>
                This dataset is available for download in CSV format from the following link: 
    <a href="https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-fatal-accidental-overdoses/resource/1c59b26a-1684-4bfb-92f7-205b947530cf" target="_blank">Fatal Accidental Overdoses Dataset</a>. </p>
                <h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong> is the relationship between age and the likelihood of fatal accidental overdose?</strong><br>The motivation for this question stems
                         from the perception that I keep hearing  that younger individuals (ages 15-35) are often reported to be at higher risk for fatal
                          drug overdoses. This interest in verifying this perception using data from the dataset aims to reveal how different age groups 
                          are affected by substance abuse and to provide a data-driven understanding of age-related risks. <br> </li>

                    <li> <strong> Are there significant differences in overdose rates across Black and White race individuals?</strong><br> The motive behind this question is  
                        to explore potential racial disparities in overdose rates, which is crucial for addressing public health inequalities. 
                        Reports from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) highlight racial and ethnic differences in drug use and overdose,
                         underscoring the importance of examining this issue in this dataset.<br></li>

                    <li><strong> How does the distribution of overdose deaths vary between males and females? </strong><br>Investigating gender differences in 
                        overdose deaths helps to understand which gender is more affected, potentially informing targeted prevention strategies. 
                        Conversations with friends suggest that males are more likely to die from drug overdoses due to higher drug usage. 
                        This dataset offers an opportunity to explore whether this perception holds true. </li>

                    <li><strong> Which top 5 years recorded the highest number of fatal accidental overdose incidents?</strong> Identifying years with peak overdose 
                        incidents can help in understanding trends and assessing the impact of interventions or policy changes over time. 
                        This question is motivated by the need to evaluate historical trends in overdose data, as it is shown here:
                         <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm" target="_blank">CDC Drug overdose death</a><br>  </li>

                    <li><strong> What are the common chemical names of drugs that lead to overdose deaths?</strong> <br> Identifying common drugs involved in
                         overdose deaths can aid in developing targeted prevention strategies and awareness campaigns to stop people 
                        taking much of them or even stop using them. This is driven by the need to understand the most harmful substances as shown here:
                        <a href="https://www.dea.gov/factsheets" target="_blank">CDC Drug overdose death</a><br> </li>
                    <li><strong> What are the geographic patterns of overdose deaths based on zip codes?</strong><br>Identifying geographic patterns of overdose deaths 
                        is crucial for recognizing areas with higher overdose rates and focusing intervention efforts effectively. 
                        The CDC's National Center for Health Statistics frequently includes geographic data in its reports, highlighting 
                        the importance of such analyses.<br></li>
                    <li><strong> What are the trends in the rates of fatal accidental overdoses over the years?</strong><br> Analyzing trends over time can reveal whether overdose 
                        rates are increasing or decreasing, helping to evaluate the effectiveness of public health measures. 
                        This question is driven by the need to track progress and adapt strategies. 
                        The CDC and National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) provide historical data and trends on overdose rates, making this analysis critical<//br></li>
